Hi! :wave: I'm a research scientist at the Llama Research team, [Meta GenAI](https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/). I focus on advancing the coding capabilities of next-generation [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) models.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Zhiqiang Lin](https://zhiqlin.github.io/). My research interests broadly lie in large language models (LLMs), program analysis, and security. 

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. The best way to reach me is via email: jin (dot) 967 (at) osu (dot) edu.
