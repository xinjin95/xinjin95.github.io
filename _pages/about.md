<!-- Hi! :wave: I'm a PhD candidate from Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) at The Ohio State University, advised by [Prof. Zhiqiang Lin](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lin.3021/). I'm also a member of [OSU SecLab](https://cse.engineering.osu.edu/computer-security-laboratory) and [NSF AI Edge Institute](https://aiedge.osu.edu/). -->

Hi! :wave: I'm a research scientist recently joining [Meta GenAI](https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/), where I build coding copilots. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Zhiqiang Lin](https://zhiqlin.github.io/). 
I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) and [Cisco Research](https://research.cisco.com/) during summer 2023 and summer 2022.

<!-- I was also a member of [OSU SecLab](https://cse.engineering.osu.edu/computer-security-laboratory) and [NSF AI Edge Institute](https://aiedge.osu.edu/). -->

I am broadly interested in large language models (LLMs), program analysis, and security. I am particularly interested in:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Program Comprehension and Generation</strong>: Understanding program semantics with LLMs/machine learning and generating program code in various programming languages.</li>
  <li><strong>Software Security</strong>: Securing software systems by program analysis and machine learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong>: Collecting, interpreting, and enriching cybersecurity data to identify and  mitigate potential threats and assist decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate. The best way to reach me is via email: jin (dot) 967 (at) osu (dot) edu.

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of ***computer security*** and ***machine learning*** (especially on ***large language models***). I'm excited about:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Automated Program Understanding</strong>: Understanding program semantics with machine learning and exploring its applications to reverse engineering tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile/IoT/Edge Security</strong>: Securing mobile/IoT/edge systems and applications by program analysis and machine learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong>: Collecting, interpreting, and enriching cybersecurity data to identify and  mitigate potential threats and assist decision-making processes.</li>
</ul> -->

<!-- I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) where I applied generative large language models to binary reverse engineering, mentored by [Jonathan Larson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jolarso/), [Weiwei Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weiwya/), and [Mike Walker](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/walkerm/) in summer 2023. I also interned at [Cisco Research](https://research.cisco.com/) working with [Ashish Kundu](https://sites.google.com/view/ashishkundu/home) on building holistic attack graphs in edge computing in summer 2022. Before joining OSU, I obtained my bachelor degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Polytechnical_University) in 2017 and then spent a gap year at University of Science and Technology of China and Fudan University. -->
